## Plotting the network as a heatmap together with dendrograms and moduel colors

"One way to visualize a weighted network is to plot its heatmap as in Figure \@ref(fig:fig7b). Each row and column of the heatmap correspond to a single gene. The heatmap can depict adjacencies or topological overlaps, with light colors denoting low adjacency (overlap) and darker colors higher adjacency (overlap). In addition, the gene dendrograms and module colors are plotted along the top and left side of the heatmap."

Here only a subset of genes are plotted since plotting allgenes are time consuming

# Open a graphical window

# Taking the dissimilarity to a power, say 10, makes the plot more informative by effectively changing 
# the color palette; setting the diagonal to NA also improves the clarity of the plot

## Plotting a heatmap of the correlations of the eigengenes
**Here different traits of interest should be included**
"It is often interesting to study the relationships among the found modules. One can use the eigengenes as representative profiles and quantify module similarity by eigengene correlation. In Figure \@ref(fig:fig8) the correlations are visualized as a heatmap. It is usually informative to add a clinical trait (or multiple traits) to the eigengenes to see how the traits fit into the eigengene network:" The eigengene dendrogram and heatmap identify groups of correlated eigengenes termed meta-modules.

```{r fig8, fig.cap="Relationships among the eigengenes and the trait", echo=FALSE}
plotEigengeneNetworks(MET, "", marDendro = c(0,4,1,2), marHeatmap = c(3,4,1,2), cex.lab = 0.8, xLabelsAngle
                       = 90)
```

```{r Code chunk 5 6, include=FALSE}
# Plot the dendrogram
sizeGrWindow(6,6);
par(cex = 1.0)
tiff(paste("./plots",name_of_analysis,"/09a_Eigengene dendrogram.tif", sep=""))
plotEigengeneNetworks(MET, "Eigengene dendrogram", marDendro = c(0,4,2,0),
                       plotHeatmaps = FALSE)
dev.off()
# Plot the heatmap matrix (note: this plot will overwrite the dendrogram plot)
par(cex = 1.0)
tiff(paste("./plots",name_of_analysis,"/09b_Eigengene adjacency heatmap.tif", sep=""))
plotEigengeneNetworks(MET, "Eigengene adjacency heatmap", marHeatmap = c(3,4,2,2),

The function produces a dendrogram of the eigengenes and trait(s), and a heatmap of their relationships. In Figures \@ref(fig:fig9a) and \@ref(fig:fig9b) the dendrogram and heatmap plots are plotted separately. Visualization of the eigengene network representing the relationships among the modules and the clinical trait weight. Figure \@ref(fig:fig9a) shows a hierarchical clustering dendrogram of the eigengenes in which the dissimilarity of eigengenes EI , EJ is given by 1 âˆ’ cor(EI , EJ ). The heatmap in Figure \@ref(fig:fig9b) shows the eigengene adjacency AI J = (1 + cor(EI , EJ ))/2.

plotEigengeneNetworks(MET, "Eigengene dendrogram", marDendro = c(0,4,2,0),
